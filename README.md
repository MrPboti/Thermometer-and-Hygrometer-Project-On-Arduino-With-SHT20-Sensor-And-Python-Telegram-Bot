 Thermometer and Hygrometer Project On Arduino With SHT20 I2C Temperature & Humidity Sensor And Python Telegram Bot

## Introduction
This is a SHT20 I2C temperature & humidity sensor with waterproof probe. It comes with the 4C CMOSens® SHT20 temperature & humidity sensor chip, and the probe has gone through dual waterproof protection. The SHT20 I2C temperature & humidity sensor adopt Sensirion new technique. Besides the capacitive type humidity sensor and the band gap temperature sensor, the chip contains an amplifier, A/D converter, OTP memory and a digital processing unit. To compare with early SHT1x series and SHT7x series, SHT20 shows better reliability and long-term stability. It can measure surrounding environment temperature and relative air humidity precisely. The Arduino SHT20 waterproof temperature & humidity sensor adopts dual waterproof protection. The inner PCB has perfusion and encapsulation protection, and the probe enclosure is made of PE waterproof materials. This is a special waterproof breathable material that allows water molecules to seep in, blocking water droplets from seeping in. The sensor won't be damaged even if it is submerged in water for a long time. There is a built-in 10k Pull-up resistor and 0.1uf filter capacitor, so It can be used directly with the microcontroller such as Arduino. Recommend DFRobot Gravity 4Pin Sensor Adapter, it is quite convenient.’
